^ This is very Mishima. Patriotism.

She wore a robe made of the hair of her victims, for she was the cause of death; and she it was whom, by yelling, drumming and stamping, they sought to drive away from the sick. Sometimes, at night, she was seen by some terrified squaw in the forest, in shape like a flame of fire; and when the vision was announced to the circle crouched around the lodge fire, they burned a fragment of meat to appease the fiend.

It was now that Brebeuf, fully conscious of the danger, half starved and half frozen, driven with revilings from every door, struck and spit upon by pretended maniacs, beheld in a vision that great cross, which as we have seen, moved onward through the air, above the wintry forests that stretched towards the land of the Iroquois


Before each of these was placed a huge portion of food, --enough, the witness declares, for four,-- and  though all were gorged to suffication, with starting eyeballs and distended veins, they still held staunchly to their task, resolved at all costs to devour the whole, in order to cure the patient, who meanwhile ceased not, in feeble tones, to praise their exertions, and implore them to persevere.

Some had sacks over their heads, with two holes for the eyes. Some were as naked as your hand, with horns or feathers on their heads, their bodies painted white, and their faces black as devils. Others were daubed with red, black and white. In short, every one decked himself as extravangantly as he could, to dance in this ballet and contribute something towards teh health of the sick man.

Suffice it for the present to say in general, that the Bacchantes of the past did not do anything more furious in their orgies. Here, they say, they are intertwined by spells, the composition of which is the nails of Bears, Wolf's teeth, Eagles' claws, certain stones and Dog nerves; It is to render blood by the mouth and nostrils, or more by a red powder, which they subtly take, and fall into fate, and wound; And ten thousand other follies which I willingly leave.

Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
But man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.
Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes and comes not again.
And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God,

Anima Christi
Soul of Christ, sanctify me.
Body of Christ, save me.
Blood of Christ, inebriate me.
Water from the side of Christ, wash me.
Passion of Christ, strengthen me.
O Good Jesus, hear me.
Within your wounds hide me.

That with your saints I may praise you
For ever and ever. Amen.
