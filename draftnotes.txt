Focus on the rituals
identify all the moments that are rites and pull them forward. They should have demarcation before and after. This can be done with the camera or the character. This is the thread.

A lot of whispering prayer. That is a crutch.

Brebeuf is a patient man but is not above manipulation to acheive what he wants. He is sanctimonius, but can be frightened by what he doesn't understand.

Right -> Up is deeper into the World

Left -> Down is farther away from reality.

Brebeuf is 'pure' as he gets closer to having a body he gets grosser. The horror of psychedlia is caught up in the horror of being embodied. 

Make him piss himself, but it's actually the pitch.
