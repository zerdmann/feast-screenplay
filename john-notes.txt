More internal thread, how does he change?
Bring more Brebeuf into the movie. Give him scenes where his philosophy is embodied.
Is this a mood piece or a 'structural' philosophy piece?
Give him more time?
Take him out of that space.
What does Jesuit space look like? Sterile? Clean. Body is hidden or diminished.

In Rabelais' fiction, the human body is a theater of transformation. His art ignores the body's smooth surface and focuses on its excrescences and its orifices: the gaping mouth, loins and anus. The grotesque body is constantly active, exceeding its margins: a body in the act of becoming. It is never finished, never completed: it is continually built, created, and builds and creates another body - Eating, drinking, defecation and other elimination (sweating, blowing of the nose, sneezing), as well as copulation, pregnancy, dismemberment, swallowing up by another body - all these acts are performed on the confines of the body and the outer world, or on the confines of the old and new body. In all events, the beginning and end of life are closely linked and interwoven.
