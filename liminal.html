<h2 class="full-slugline">EXT - HURON FOREST - DAWN (SOUNDSTAGE)</h2>

<p class="action">Wide Shot - soft ambient light, no obvious source, but falls off quickly. The sound-stage has been set with thick pine trunks to resemble a forest. Fr BREBEUF kneels in front of stained glass window suspended in the air. His black robe is hiked up so his knobby knees are shaking in the frosty dirt He clutches a wooden rosary in his right hand and whispers prayers to himself.</p>

<h5 class="goldman-slugline">MONTAGE</h5>

<p class="action">- Roving CUs of Brebeuf bony hands and knees. Wiry mustache hair hangs over his upper lip. The texture of his robe is illuminated in waves of blue light.</p>

<p class="action">- OTS of Brebeuf. Finally we see the stained glass straight on. It is a white cross on a field of dark blue and purple. A burning lamplight gleams behind the stained glass, only visible through the portal. Brebeuf stands, silhouetted in the gleaming light.</p>

<h2 class="full-slugline">EXT - HURON VILLAGE - EARLY MORNING (SOUNDSTAGE)</h2>

<p class="action">OTS: Brebeuf walks crossing from lower left to just above center. Ahead of him is a wooden long-house, with a shaggy bark roof. Behind the long-house is a MATTE PAINTING of several more houses along the glittering shore of Lake Huron.</p>

<h2 class="full-slugline">INT/EXT - HURON LONGHOUSE (SOUNDSTAGE)</h2>



<p class="action">Framed up tight around the long-house. A border of sound-stage creating a matte around the action. Brebeuf walks through the curtain.</p>

<h2 class="full-slugline">INT - LONGHOUSE</h2>

<p class="action">An OLD WOMAN sitting by the door hisses when she sees Brebeuf enter.</p>

<dt class="character">OLD WOMAN</dt>
<dd class="dialogue">There are no sick or dying here! Get! Take your evil medicine to our enemies if your god is still hungry.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="action">She pulls at Brebeuf's robe and he clutches it close as he walks past her.</p>

<p class="action">The long-house is full of Huron young and old. Brebeuf makes his way to the center of the long-house. Seated in a half-circle around a large fire are the elders of the tribe. CANCERMAN stands opposite them, back to us, gesturing and speaking excitedly. </p>

<dt class="character">CANCERMAN</dt>

<p class="action">Brebeuf kneels near the fire.</p>

<p class="action">Reverse of Cancerman. His sweaty face gleams in the fire-light. His right arm is swollen with tumors.</p>

<dl>
<dt class="character">CANCERMAN</dt>
<dd class="parenthetical">(haltingly)</dd>
<dd class="dialogue">I wore wampum beaded with the stars in the night sky, and sat at the head of a feast. The spirit of the great beaver came. He visited with me and saw the honor of our feast and was pleased...and I saw the great Huron spirit. All our ancestor spirits circled around him as he came, whispering the great stories of the Huron...remembering the strength of our nation. </dd>

<p class="action">Cancerman collapses in front of the fire, next to the still kneeling Brebeuf. The elders confer amongst each other. Brebeuf feels something on his hands, he lifts his fingers and they are black with pitch.</p>

<h5 class="goldman-slugline">OUT OF PLACE - EXT - WOODS</h5>

<p class="action">Brebeuf sits, writing to himself. A group of Huron children enter, chasing a boy in a mask. A few of the children peel away from the group and gather around Brebeuf. </p>

<p class="action">Brebeuf looks up to meet the eyes of three Huron children, the largest has his hand held out.</p>

<p class="action">Brebeuf pulls a small leather pouch from his robe. He opens the drawstring and is about to shake it's contents into the hand when he stops. He hums a few bars of the Huron Carol and then waits.</p>

<p class="action">The children sheepishly start to sing a few lines in Wendat. One child starts to cough during the song and stops.</p>

<p class="action">CU of hands - Brebeuf pours out a swollen golden raisin. The sun beams through it a little.</p>

<p class="action">As the children start to run off, Brebeuf stops the one who coughed. He holds the boy's head in his hands and looks into his eyes. He starts to sign the cross over the boy when...</p>

<p class="action">Startled, the boy runs off.</p>


<h2 class="full-slugline">EXT - WOODS - LATE MORNING/AFTERNOON (SOUNDSTAGE)</h2>

<p class="action">The camera tracks down a line of women and Brebeuf, polishing copper kettles in circular motions. Behind them a band of hunters pulls a birch-bark sledge piled with game animals.</p>

<p class="action">Mixed shots of the following: </p>

<p class="action">A woman pounds corn flour with water and smoked meat. CU of corn batter cakes frying on cast iron pan.</p>

<p class="action">Squash being split in half with a hatchet and laid out in a ring around the fire. CU of their skin peeling.</p>

<p class="action">A bubbling copper kettle, steaming meat and beans.</p>

<p class="action">Pan through the glass bottle of brandy, light flickering in and out of the rich gold liquid. Pull back as a hand pulls the cork out and sniffs the mouth.</p>

<p class="action">Fat rendering on a cast iron pan.</p>

<p class="action">Top down - Green thin boughs laid over a small fire, while whole trout hang from racks above.</p>

<p class="action">Tobacco leaves rubbed through fingers and packed into a bowl. XCU of the edges of the tobacco lighting and curling and the wafts of smoke drifting off. Long shot, the whole puff.</p>

<p class="action">A laughing group sit on a log.</p>

<p class="action">Grains of salt are shaved off a small block with a knife. XCU of the grains dissolving in the surface of the broth.</p>

<p class="action">Shucking fresh oysters. CU of their meat quivering. The slurping.</p>

<p class="action"><i>Somewhere storytelling needs to happen, tease out the hallucination</i></p>

<h2 class="full-slugline">EXT - LONGHOUSE - EVENING (SOUNDSTAGE) </h2>

<p class="action">Center framed shot looking down the longhouse from outside. The front face of the longhouse is cut away. But our framing includes a few trees and the surrounding darkness. A small fire burns in the middle. The feast has mostly subsided. Many people sleep or pass smoking pipes around. Smoke wafts gently up through the hole in the roof. A child sits restlessly down and left of the action. The child coughs gently to himself.</p>

<p class="action">Snow falls gently on the outside.</p>

<p class="action">After a minute, Brebeuf gets up and slowly crosses from the upper right of the frame. He approaches the child and bends over.</p>

<h3 class="right-transition">CUT TO:</h3>

<h5 class="goldman-slugline">POV - BREBEUF'S FACE</h5>

<p class="action">CU of Brebeuf's face he holds the child. He runs his hands along the edge of the camera, and clicks softly to himself. He quietly spits on his fingers and makes the sign of the cross on the child's forehead.</p>

<dt class="character">BREBEUF</dt>
<dd class="dialogue">In nomine patri, et filli, et spiritus sancti...</dd>

<h2 class="full-slugline">EXT - LONGHOUSE - EVENING (SOUNDSTAGE) </h2>

<p class="action">When Brebeuf doesn't stir, he is lifted by the arms. The spot where he laid is coated with black pitch and it drips from his robe. The Huron carrying him rotate him, pull him toward the camera and throw him...</p>

<h2 class="full-slugline">EXT - VILLAGE - NIGHT (SOUNDSTAGE)</h2>

<p class="action">Brebeuf lands face down in a beam of light, illuminating the frost covered ground.</p>

<p class="action"><i>More shit here. get him out of the village. Maybe some mythical Huron thing</i></p>

<h2 class="full-slugline">EXT - WOODS - NIGHT (SOUNDSTAGE)</h2>

<p class="action">Brebeuf is groping his way through the woods. Hounded by the whooping of the Huron feast.</p>

<p class="action">He reaches a gentle clearing flanked by powerful oak trunks. He falls to his knees. For just a fraction of second he is safe. The light intensifies to a spotlight.</p>

<p class="action">Suddenly, from behind all the trees pop the heads of a painted band of Iroquois warriors. A musical sting. Brebeuf looks up. He scrambles to his feet as they tauntingly come out from the trees. He runs.</p>

<p class="action">Tracking shot from right to left as Brebeuf flees. Iroquois dance in and out of the trees, seeming to appear and disappear behind trees as they will.</p>
